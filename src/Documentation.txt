This is the ranked choice UI created by Brian and Kutub
This project was built for Dr. Wallach, Dr. Acemyan, and Dr. Kortum of Rice University
The purpose of this project was to test different voting UIs
This project can track when buttons are pressed, and downloads that data as a txt file
The best UI will be chosen based on the button press information
The project, deployed, can be found at abriantran.github.io/voting-terminal
This project was built using React.js, a javascript framework
React uses a parent-child hierarchy of classes and objects of those classes
Any object can have props (properties) and/or a state
These are both variable storage, but state will re-render an object when it is updated
The classes in this project are based on the Google Civic Data API
In addition, the json data this project reads in is formatted like the Google Civic Data API suggests
The general layout of this Project is as such:
StartPage.jsx is the, well, start page. It references ResearcherPicker.jsx
This file has the two researchers and the "default" San Francisco Style voting UI
Using the start page, you can choose which UI you wish to see
Each researcher (default San Francisco is considered a researcher for consistency) has their own jsx file with different logic
Each Researcher jsx refers to the same CandidateTable class as children
The CandidateTable class has candidates.jsx as a child
There are other children and references, but these are the main ones
